Spotify Replica Project Project Overview This project is a simplified replica of Spotify, a popular music streaming service, built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to create a static website that mimics the basic layout and design of Spotify's web interface. This project serves as a foundational exercise in front-end web development, focusing on the use of HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
